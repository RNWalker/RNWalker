I recently completed my medical degree, and my passion for technology is deeply rooted in my belief that it offers a powerful avenue to amplify my impact and embark on new paths of creative problem-solving. 

With a solid foundation in critical thinking, research, and interpersonal skills gained from my medical background, I am well-prepared to excel in the dynamic realm of technology.

I am commited to leveraging technology for positive change, and I am particularly enthusiastic about leveraging innovation to enhance healthcare delivery.
